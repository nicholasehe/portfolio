            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This was a personal 1-week project in which the challenge was to redesign the layout of a website to better suit a particular audience's needs. The users I focused on were new customers not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory's online menu.
                Because the interface for the current online menu lacks sufficient information for new customers, I redesigned the menu section to include features to help users navigate the menu. Throughout the process, I used the Nielson Norman Group's
                Design Thinking framework.</p>
            <p id="role"><strong>Role: </strong>User Researcher, UI Designer, Frontend Developer</p>
            <p id="duration"><strong>Duration: </strong> 1 week</p>
            <p id="tools"><strong>Tools used: </strong>Figma, HTML5, CSS3</p>

        <div class="empathize">
            <h2>Empathize - Understanding User Pain Points</h2>
            <p>According to an <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-vs-deep-hierarchy/">article by the Nielson Norman Group</a> on information architecture and flat vs. deep website hierarchies, content is more discoverable when not nested within
                many layers. The first issue with the current information architecture is that there are too many choices displayed in the online menu. According to Hick's Law, as the number of options increase, the time needed to respond or execute an
                action increases. This results in an especially poor user experience when the customer is hungry, and this situation can even lead to frustration. The second issue is that the current menu layout contains numerous items nested under many
                different layers. This results in the user needing to click many times in order to reach important information on every item (such as images and food descriptions). In order to better understand user pain points within their experience
                interacting with the menu, I created a user journey map:
            </p>
            <div class="user-journey">
                <img id="journey-map" src="./images/ccf-journey-map.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="define">
            <h2>Define - Determining User Needs and Goals </h2>
            <p>After understanding where user pain points were during the interaction process, I defined several key user needs and goals by creating a persona:</p>
            <div class="personas">
                <img src="./images/ccf-persona.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="ideate">
            <h2>Ideate - Generating Potential Solutions</h2>
            <p>To address user needs, I brainstormed potential features to add so that the interface is optimized for both quick ordering and exploring menu items:</p>
            <div class="brainstorm">
                <img src="./images/ccf-brainstorm.jpg" alt="brainstorming">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="prototype">
            <h2>Prototype - Improving user experience with a new interface</h2>
            <p>To implement a solution for an improved user experience, I sketched out the design and created a annotated high-fidelity prototype with Figma. I used a grid layout instead of the list-based information architecture on the current website.
                This layout provides images and summarizes important information for each item without the user needing to scroll or click numerous times. This is especially important for new customers since they want to see what each dish looks like
                before ordering takeout. I also included a "Popular Right Now" section to give new users a sense of which menu items are frequently ordered by others, which gives them an idea of what they might want to order if they have trouble deciding.
                In addition, a I implemented a new sidebar containing a dropdown list of menu items for easy navigation. This sidebar allows users to look at each section of the menu without having to go back to a webpage dedicated for each section.
