            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Boost is a mobile food-ordering app for college students, where users can order from both off-campus chain establishments and on-campus dining locations. Mobile ordering is becoming more and more popular among college students, and the COVID-19
                pandemic has made mobile ordering an essential service. The purpose of this case study was to look into why the App Store ratings for the Boost mobile food ordering app are relatively low compared to similar apps, and redesign the user
                experience so that user pain points are resolved. During the case study, I followed the Nielson Norman Group's Design Thinking framework (elaborate more).

            <h2>Empathize - Understanding User Pain Points</h2>
            <p>(According to an article by Cook Tucson) make a link, many large universities must deliver dining experiences to student populations of 40,000 or more in a rapid manner. When it comes to dining services, social media apps are not enough to
                reach this many students, so scaling up dining services to this magnitude requires the use of mobile ordering, especially when students frequently use their phones (source: <cite><a href="https://cooktucson.com/2017/02/new-tech-trends/">Cook Tucson</a></cite>).
                In the case of Boost, many students who reviewed the app found that ordering was slow and complained that many essential ordering functions were missing. Of course there are many other food ordering apps out there, but students' app choices
                for mobile ordering are often dictated by their university, which settles on a single app.

            <h2>Define - Determining User Needs and Goals</h2>
            <p>To understand users, their goals, and their needs better, I created two personas, each representing a different type of user: utilitarian and hedonic. Utilitarian users want to quickly order food and often from the nearest locations. On the
                other hand, hedonic users like to explore different dining locations, and might not mind traveling relatively long distances to pick up their order.</p>

            <h2>Prototype - Mapping out User Interaction</h2>
            <p>After brainstorming ideas on how to improve Boost's user experience, I used Figma for low-fidelity wireframing and creating an interaction map to explore how user would interact with new features.</p>

                <li>I learned the importance of empathizing and understanding users and their needs</li>
                <li>I further developed my wireframing and interaction mapping skills in Figma</li>
                <li id="hackable-list-item"> Most importantly, I learned how using a design framework can lead to clearly defined problems and solutions, and ultimately a better UX design</li>
