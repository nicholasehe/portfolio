            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hackable is a personal project where the design challenge was to create a mobile app prototype that fit users' needs based on user research and survey data. With the COVID-19 pandemic, many peoples' lives have become stressful, so I chose
                to design an app that provides DIY project resources to make peoples' live easier and tasks less expensive, and to relieve boredom for those staying home during the pandemic.

        <div class="user-research">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>According a 2017 survey done by CORGI Homeplan, 52% of millenials do not know how to hang wallpaper, 1 in 10 millennial men said that there is an "unsafe DIY fix in their home", and 23% of millenials would rather hire someone else to fix something
                in their home (source: <cite><a href="https://www.bigissue.com/latest/why-millennials-dont-diy-a-very-21st-century-problem/">The Big Issue</a></cite>). Much of the problem lies in individuals not having tools to perform DIY projects/repairs.</p>
            <p>Hackable is a social app that focuses on sharing DIY project ideas, tips, and everyday life hacks, The app also acts as an all-in-one mini toolbox, such as an augmented reality ruler, decibel reader, calculator, and currency converter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ui-design">
            <h2>UI Design</h2>
            <p>One of the main user experience aspects within Hackable is the widgets page, in which users can access a wide range of measuring and calculation tools. As mentioned before, tool access is one of the main reasons why many individuals do not
                engage in DIY projects. Thus, having access to measurement tools on a mobile device can be convenient. When designing the widgets page, I arranged widgets in a grid layout to highlight the functional relationships between these widget
                components. In addition, users can change the size and position of widgets within the grid for their preferred layout.</p>

            <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned the importance of how user data plays a role in ideating</li>
                <li>I practiced developing an intuitive user experience flow with wireframing</li>
                <li>I used Figma to create a functional and testable prototype</li>
                <li id="hackable-list-item">I became more familiar with the iterative design process, from developing wireframes to a functional prototype then repeating the process to create better navigation.</li>
