            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In the fall of 2018, I joined Cornell University's D.U.E.T. (Design for User Experience with Technology) Lab as a user experience researcher and designer. In 2019, I became the lead researcher for a virtual reality simulation study for the
                effects of indoor vegetation design on shopping intentions. In the summer of 2020, I presented my research paper and findings at two design conferences: EDRA51 (Environmental Design Researchers Association) and IAPS 2020 (International
                Association of People-Environment Studies).

            <h2>Experiment Design</h2>
            <p>Utilizing the 3D modeling and rendering programs Autodesk Revit and Unreal Game Engine 4, I designed four different virtual environments (two cafes and two retail stores). During the experiment, participants wore a virtual reality headset
                and experienced all four environments, and answered a set of self-report questions regarding shopping intentions and individual differences (connectedness to nature).</p>

        <div class="results">
            <h2>Data Analysis & Results</h2>
            <p>I analyzed user data from the study using JMP Pro and SPSS statistical software, and the results suggested that indoor vegetation was more effective in producing positive shopping intentions in the cafe environment than the retail store environment.
                From the data gathered for participants' individual differences, it was observed that participants with a higher connectedness to nature score tended to express more positive shopping intentions than those who had a lower score.

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I recognized the value of quantifying individual differences as major factors in user experience research</li>
                <li>I learned how to implement virtual reality as a viable method of assessing spatial user experience</li>
                <li>I familiarized myself with various 3D modeling software</li>
                <li>I strengthed my knowledge in statistical data analysis</li>
                <li id="vr-list-item">Most importantly, I went through the iterative process of developing a research model, conducting pilot studies, filtering out what factors most significantly impact consumer needs and desires, and then developing a more robust research
                    model.
